Contributing
============

Galore is managed by the Scanlon Materials Theory group at University
College London, and is open to contributions from third parties. If
you have an idea to make Galore better, please open an Issue outlining
your idea on the `Github issue tracker
<https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/galore/issues>`__.  This will allow a
public discussion of how well this fits the project design and goals,
and how it might be implemented.

Making changes
--------------

All contributions from third parties are managed using "Pull requests" on Github,
as are major changes by the core developers.
Create a copy of the project on your own Github account using the
"Fork" button near the top-right of the web interface and make your changes
on a new branch based on ``master``.
When you are ready to share these changes, create a pull request;
this will open a public discussion
`here <https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/galore/pulls>`__.

Before making substantial changes, *please begin discussion in an
Issue* so you have some idea if your proposal is likely to be
accepted!  For minor corrections it may be easier to move straight to
a pull request.

Galore is licensed under GPLv3 (see LICENSE file), including any
third-party contributions.
