Introduction
------------

Galore is a package which applies Gaussian and Lorentzian broadening
to data from *ab initio* calculations. The two main intended
applications are

1. Application of Lorentzian instrumental broadening to simulated Raman
   spectra from DFPT calculations.
2. Gaussian and Lorentzian broadening of electronic density-of-states,
   with orbital weighting to simulate UPS/XPS/HAXPES measurements.


Documentation
-------------

A brief overview is given in this README file.
Full documentation can be built using Sphinx; try ``make html`` from
the *docs* directory of this project.
Pre-compiled documentation will be made available through `readthedocs
<https://readthedocs.org>`__ when this project is made publicly
viewable.

Usage
-----

For full documentation of the command-line flags, please use the
in-built help::

    galore -h

Instrumental broadening
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data may be provided as a set of X,Y coordinates in a text file of
comma-separated values (CSV).
Whitespace-separated data is also readable, in which case a *.txt*
file extension should be used.

To plot a CSV file to the screen with default Lorentzian broadening (2
cm\ :sup:`-1`), use the command::

    galore MY_DATA.csv -l -p

and to plot to a file with more generous 10 cm\ :sup:`-1` broadening::

    galore MY_DATA.csv -l 10 -p MY_PLOT.png

will provide the additional data needed. 

Other file formats are supported, including IR and Raman intensity
simulation output. See the Tutorials for usage examples.

Photoionization spectra
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

UPS, XPS or HAXPES spectra can be simulated using Galore. This requires
several inputs:

- Orbital-projected density of states data. 
- Instrumental broadening parameters. The Lorentzian and Gaussian
  broadening widths are input by the user as before.
- Photoionization cross section data, which is used to weight the
  contributions of different orbitals. Galore includes data for
  valance band orbitals at Al k-Î± (XPS) and He II (UPS) energies,
  drawn from a more extensive table computed by
  `Yeh and Lindau (1985) <https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-640X(85)90016-6>`__.
  An alternative dataset may be provided as a JSON file; it is only
  necessary to include the elements and orbitals used in the DOS input
  files.

See the Tutorials for a walkthrough using sample data.

Requirements
------------

Galore is currently compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. It is
*strongly* recommended that you install Galore with Python 3, as many
scientific Python libraries are committed to dropping Python 2 support
`by the end of 2020 <http://www.python3statement.org>`__.

Galore uses Numpy to apply convolution operations. Matplotlib is
required for plotting.

Galore uses Pip and setuptools for installation. You *probably* already
have this; if not, your GNU/Linux package manager will be able to oblige
with a package named something like ``python-setuptools``. On Max OSX,
the Python distributed with `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`__ includes
setuptools and Pip.

Installation
------------

Windows user installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ is recommended for
managing the Python environment and dependencies on Windows. From the
Anaconda shell::

    pip3 install .

Linux/Mac developer installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the directory containing this README::

    pip3 install --user -e .

which installs an *editable* (``-e``) version of galore in your
userspace. The executable program ``galore`` goes to a user directory
like ``~/.local/bin`` (which may need to be added to your PATH) and
the galore library should be available on your PYTHONPATH. These are
links to the project source folder, which you can continue to edit and
update using Git.

Installation for documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to build the documentation you can add ``[docs]`` to the
pip command to ensure you have all the Sphinx requirements and
extensions::

   pip3 install --upgrade .[docs]

Development
-----------

This code is developed by the Scanlon Materials Theory Group based at
University College London. Suggestions and contributions are welcome;
please use the Github issue tracker.
