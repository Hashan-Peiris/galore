abstract = {The changes in density, wave functions, and self-consistent potentials$\backslash$nof solids, in response to small atomic displacements or infinitesimal$\backslash$nhomogeneous electric fields, are considered in the framework of the$\backslash$ndensity-functional theory. A variational: principle for second-order$\backslash$nderivatives of the energy provides a basis for efficient algorithmic$\backslash$napproaches to these linear responses, such as the state-by-state$\backslash$nconjugate-gradient algorithm presented here in detail. The phase$\backslash$nof incommensurate perturbations of periodic systems, that are, like$\backslash$nphonons, characterized by some wave vector, can be factorized: the$\backslash$nincommensurate problem is mapped on an equivalent one presenting$\backslash$nthe periodicity of the unperturbed ground state. The singularity$\backslash$nof the potential change associated with an homogeneous field is treated$\backslash$nby the long-wave method. The efficient implementation of these theoretical$\backslash$nideas using plane waves, separable pseudopotentials, and a nonlinear$\backslash$nexchange-correlation core correction is described in detail, as well$\backslash$nas other technical issues.},

abstract = {A direct approach to calculate the phonon dispersion using an ab initio force constant method is introduced. The phonon dispersion and structural instability of cubic ZrO2 are found using a supercell method in the local-density approximation. The force constants are determined from the Hellmann-Feynman forces induced by the displacement of an atom in the 2×2×2 fcc supercell. This size of the supercell gives “exact” phonon frequencies at $\gamma$,X,L,W Brillouin zone points. The phonon dispersion curves show a pronounced soft mode at the X point, in agreement with the experimentally observed cubic to tetragonal phase transition.},

@article{Togo2015a,
abstract = {We explore the role of entanglement in adiabatic quantum optimization by performing approximate simulations of the real-time evolution of a quantum system while limiting the amount of entanglement. To classically simulate the time evolution of the system with a limited amount of entanglement, we represent the quantum state using matrix-product states and projected entangled-pair states. We show that the probability of finding the ground state of an Ising spin glass on either a planar or non-planar two-dimensional graph increases rapidly as the amount of entanglement in the state is increased. Furthermore, we propose evolution in complex time as a way to improve simulated adiabatic evolution and mimic the effects of thermal cooling of the quantum annealer.},
